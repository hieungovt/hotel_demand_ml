## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book documents the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project for predicting hotel booking cancellations and forecasting demand, following the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology.

### Project Overview

The hospitality industry faces significant challenges with booking cancellations. This project develops predictive models to:

1. **Predict Cancellation Risk**: Classify bookings by their likelihood of cancellation
2. **Forecast Demand**: Time series analysis to predict future booking volumes
3. **Enable Proactive Management**: Provide actionable insights for revenue management

### CRISP-DM Phases Covered

| Phase | Description | Chapter |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Business Understanding | Define objectives and success criteria | @sec-business |
| Data Understanding | Explore and assess data quality | @sec-data-understanding |
| Data Preparation | Clean, transform, and engineer features | @sec-data-preparation |
| Modeling | Train and tune prediction models | @sec-modeling |
| Evaluation | Assess model performance | @sec-evaluation |
| Deployment | Productionize and serve models | @sec-deployment |

### Dataset

We use the **Hotel Booking Demand** dataset, which contains booking information for two types of hotels:

- **Resort Hotel**: 40,060 bookings
- **City Hotel**: 79,330 bookings

The data spans from July 2015 to August 2017 and includes 32 features describing each booking.
